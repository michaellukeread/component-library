# Component Library

[You can view the component library here](https://focused-wing-15c691.netlify.app/ 'Component Library')

## What is it?

This is a component library with curated components, selected and developed by myself.

### What is a component?

Components are independent and reusable bits of code. For example: a Button

## Why?

So that I can lean on these reuseable components to speed up development of future projects instead of remaking it each time.
